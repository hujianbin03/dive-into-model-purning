# dive-into-model-purning
This is an implementation of model pruning, which includes the basic concepts, structure and standards of 
model pruning, pruning methods, sparse training, pruning tools, and practical applications based on VGG 
model pruning.

**Can help you get started with model pruning very well**

However, it is worth noting that all code does not run in a command-line manner. You can refer to the 
readme in each directory to learn and execute the code.
***
## Prerequisites
- python >= 3.5
- pytorch==0.4.0

You can install required packages by:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
***
## Model

By using custom models and a simplified version of VGG, you can quickly train and reason on your own 
computer.
***
## DATASET

Using CIFAR10 and MNIST, the dataset is small, but the results can be quickly verified.
